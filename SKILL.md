# Agent Team Management

Manage team member information including skills, roles, and work assignments.

## Commands

All commands are executed via the `team.py` script:

```bash
python3 scripts/team.py <command> [options]
```

### List Members

List all team members in table format:

```bash
python3 scripts/team.py list
```

Output example:
```

Add a new member or update an existing one:

```bash
python3 scripts/team.py update \
  --agent-id "agent-001" \
  --name "Alice" \
  --role "Backend Developer" \
  --enabled true \
  --tags "backend,api,database" \
